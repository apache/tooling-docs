# Security Advisory Process "Phase"

When security advisories are announced there needs to be co-ordination between Security tooling such as cveprocess.apache.org and the ATR.

For every impacted release with an SBOM we could link SBOMs to advisories.

Per @raboof: "SBOMs should ideally be immutable metadata for release artifacts and not touched afterwards. There are various 'SBOM-adjacent' formats to link SBOMs/artifacts to advisories, though ([notably VDR](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SECURITY/How+to+publish+an+advisory)) and we definitely might want to publish those in the future"

> Note: whether this is an explicit phase or not depends on integration discussions with the security team. [Current feedback from Arnout](https://the-asf.slack.com/archives/C049WADAAQG/p1738673273324409) is that we should defer this feature for now.
