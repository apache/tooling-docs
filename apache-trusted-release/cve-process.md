# Update SBOMs - CVE Process "Phase"

When CVEs are announced there needs to be co-ordination between Security's cveprocess.apache.org and the ATR.

For every impacted release with an SBOM the SBOMs will need to be updated.

> Note where this is an explicit phase or not depends on integration discussions with the security team.
