## What is ASF Tooling?

ASF Tooling is an ASF Initiative launched in March 2025 to meet the growing global demand
for ASF software by hardening ubiquitous Apache projects that benefit the greater
open source ecosystem.

We are developing new tooling that will help ASF’s open source project communities
streamline development, automate repetitive tasks, reduce technical debt, and better
collaborate. Additional Initiatives are in the planning stages including security
capabilities that meet the EU's Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and US’s CISA recommendations.
New products being developed under the Tooling Initiative are separate from the tools
developed by ASF Infrastructure.

### Tooling Goals

1. Automate the Release Process around compliance guiding ASF open source projects to
   providing the SBOMs and other attestations needed in a secure software supply chain.
2. Automate the Release Process for the benefit of PMCs while also reducing infrastructure
   costs and management complexity.
